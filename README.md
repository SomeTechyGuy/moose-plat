Thank you for downloading this game that i made! It means a lot.


Make sure to unzip the zip folder or it will have an error.

My YouTube channel is [@franksyoutubechannel](https://youtube.com/@franksyoutubechannel) if you want that for some reason and i hope you guys enjoy!

I might upload devlogs and stuff on there so check that out.

Its hard to program lol. If i dont update consitantly then thats on me. I dont have a schedule so i may not realase consistant updates. Please do not harass me because my friend does that for me. 

I am making this FOSS so I engage you guys to make mods and fan games.





Thank you!
